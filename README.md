# Diabetes

In this project I using PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset to make machine learning model (predictive analys). I'm using random forest and decision tree, the popular solution one. The result are random forest with 75% and decision tree around more than 70%. The accuracy is not good nor bad either but still need some improvements.

### Variable in Dataset

- *Pregnancies*
- *Glucose*
- *Blood Pressure*
- *SkinThickness*
- Insulin
- *DiabetsPedigreeFunction*
- BMI: *Body mass index* 
- *Age* : age in year type
